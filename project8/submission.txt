Brief description to see the story in action:
On the top bar, there is a checkbox called "private" and a dropdown checkbox menu of user names to control the visibility of uploaded photo. If "private" checkbox is unchecked, everyone can see the uploaded photo regardless of selected user in the dropdown menu. However, if the "private" checkbox is checked, only the owner of the photo and selected users from the dropdown menu can see the uploaded photo. If no user is specified for checked "private" condition, it means only the owner can see the uploaded photo. All the photos from the default database are visible to every user.
